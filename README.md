# House-Price-Prediction-Model

## Business Problem:
It is desired to carry out a machine learning project regarding the prices of different types of houses by using the dataset containing the features and house prices of each house.

## Dataset Story:
There are 79 explanatory variables in this data set of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. You can access the data set and competition page of the project, which also has a competition on Kaggle, from the link below. Since the data set belongs to a Kaggle competition, there are two different csv files: train and test. House prices are left blank in the test data set, and you are expected to guess these values.
